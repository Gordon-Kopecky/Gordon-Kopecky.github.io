    <p>My name is Gordon Kopecky! Welcome to my About me page. Im a sophomore here at uri and just switched my major in computer science this year. So far I am really enjoying it! Some things I like to do are hang out with friends, play sports, go to the beach, and pretty much anything that will give me an adrenaline rush LOL!! Im super excited to learn how to program, although it is difficult and takes a lot of time and commitment, I'm ready for what's to come! </p>
